# Startled

This is a set of initialization scripts that use common tools and shell scripts to help me prototype projects.

It makes heavy use of npm as a script runner and package.json for storing project data.

The project's capabilities can be extended by running scripts (see below).

## Pre-requesties

These commands are designed to work on linux and unix machines, including machines running macOS.

If you're running Windows 10 Professional, you can run them using the [Windows subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) or within a [Docker container](https://docker.com).

If you're running some other version of Windows, the npm scripts _should_ work, but extension scripts will fail. You might want to try [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) in this case, or try downloading and running the script source manually.

Ensure that these utilities are installed first:

- [sh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)
- [node / npm](https://nodejs.org)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se)
(curl is only necessary for extension scripts)

## Usage

In your project directory, run the following script:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnhenry/startled/master/init.sh)"
```

This and also adds get, set, and delete npm scripts that allow manipulation of the package as a key-value store.

Once you've run that script, you can run any of below installation scripts to add functionality to your project.

### NPM run Scripts

Running installation scripts will usually add an npm command.

The following commands are installed when adding the above initial script.

#### get: read a value from package.json

```bash
npm run get < path in package.json >
```

#### set: add a key to package.json

```bash
npm run set < path in package.json > 'value to set'
```

#### delete: remove a key from package.json

```bash
npm run delete < path in package.json >
```

### included files

#### .npmrc
	set up with 'save=true' to save installed dependencies automatically

#### .gitignore
	set up to ignore 'node_modules/' folder
